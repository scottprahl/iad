@*1 Initialization.

The functions in this file assume that the local variables |MM| and |RR|
have been initialized appropriately.  The variable |MM| contains all the 
information about how a particular experiment was done.  The structure
|RR| contains the data structure that is passed to the adding-doubling routines
as well as the number of quadrature points.

@*1 Gain.

Assume that a sphere is illuminated with diffuse light having a power
$P$. 
This light can reach all parts of sphere --- specifically, light from
this source is not blocked by a baffle.  Multiple reflections in the
sphere will increase the power falling on non-white areas in the sphere
(e.g., the sample, detector, and entrance)  To find the total we need to
sum all the total of all incident light at a point.  The first incidence
is
$$
P_w^{(1)} = a_w P, \qquad P_s^{(1)} = a_s P, \qquad P_d^{(1)} = a_d P
$$
The light from the detector and sample is multiplied by $(1-a_e)$ and
not by $a_w$ because the light from the detector (and sample) is not
allowed to hit either the detector or sample.  The second incidence on
the wall is
$$
P_w^{(2)} = a_w r_w P_w^{(1)} + (1-a_e) r_d P_d^{(1)} + (1-a_e)\rdiffuse
 P_s^{(1)}
$$
The light that hits the walls after $k$ bounces has the same form as
above 
$$
P_w^{(k)} = a_w r_w P_w^{(k-1)} + (1-a_e) r_d  P_d^{(k-1)} + (1-a_e)
\rdiffuse P_s^{(k-1)}
$$
Since the light falling on the sample and detector must come from the
wall
$$
P_s^{(k)} = a_s r_w P_w^{(k-1)} \qquad\hbox{and}\qquad  P_d^{(k)} = a_d
r_w P_w^{(k-1)},
$$
Therefore,
$$
P_w^{(k)} = a_w r_w P_w^{(k-1)} + (1-a_e) r_w (a_d r_d + a_s \rdiffuse)
P_w^{(k-2)}
$$
The total power falling on the walls is just
$$
P_w = \sum_{k=1}^\infty P_w^{(k)} = {a_w + (1-a_e) ( a_d r_d +a_s
\rdiffuse) 
\over 1- a_w r_w - (1-a_e)r_w(a_d r_d + a_s \rdiffuse)} P
$$
The total power falling the detector is
$$
P_d = a_d P + \sum_{k=2}^\infty a_d r_w P_w^{(k-1)} = a_d P + a_d r_w
P_w
$$

The gain $G(\rdiffuse)$ on the irradiance on the detector (relative to a
black sphere),
$$
G(\rdiffuse) \equiv {P_d /A_d\over P/A} 
$$
in terms of the sphere parameters
$$
G(\rdiffuse)  = 1+ {1\over a_w} \cdot {a_w r_w + (1-a_e) r_w (a_d r_d
+a_s \rdiffuse)  \over 1- a_w r_w - (1-a_e)r_w(a_d r_d + a_s \rdiffuse)}
$$
The gain for a detector in a transmission sphere is similar, but with
primed parameters to designate a second potential sphere that is used.
For a black sphere the gain $G(0) = 1$, which is easily verified by
setting $r_w=0$, $\rdiffuse=0$, and $r_d=0$.  Conversely, when the
sphere walls and sample are perfectly white, the irradiance at the
entrance port, the sample port, and the detector port must increase so
that the total power leaving via these ports is equal to the incident
diffuse power $P$.  
Thus the gain should be the ratio of the sphere wall area over the area
of the ports through which light leaves or $G(1)=A/(A_e+A_d)$ which
follows immediately from the gain formula with $r_w=1$, $\rdiffuse=1$,
and $r_d=0$.


@ The gain $G(r_s)$ on the irradiance on the detector (relative to a black sphere),
$$
G(r_s) \equiv {P_d /A_d\over P/A} 
$$
in terms of the sphere parameters
$$
G(r_s)  = 1+ {a_w r_w + (1-a_e) r_w (a_d r_d +a_s r_s) 
\over 1- a_w r_w - (1-a_e)r_w(a_d r_d + a_s r_s)}
$$

@ The reflected power for two spheres makes use of the formulas for
|Gain_11| above.

The light
on the detector in the reflection (first) sphere arises from three
sources: the fraction of light directly reflected off the sphere wall $f
r_w^2 (1-a_e) P$, the fraction of light reflected by the sample $(1-f)
\rdirect r_w^2 (1-a_e) P$, and the light transmitted through the sample
$(1-f) \tdirect r_w' (1-a_e') P$,
$$
\eqalign{
R(\rdirect,\rdiffuse,\tdirect,\tdiffuse) 
&= G_{1\rightarrow1}(\rdiffuse,\tdiffuse) \cdot a_d (1-a_e) r_w^2 f  P \cr
&+ G_{1\rightarrow1}(\rdiffuse,\tdiffuse) \cdot a_d (1-a_e) r_w (1-f) \rdirect  P \cr
&+ G_{2\rightarrow1}(\rdiffuse,\tdiffuse) \cdot a_d (1-a_e') r_w' (1-f) \tdirect  P \cr

@*1 Grid Routines.
There is a long story associated with these routines.  I spent a lot of time 
trying to find an empirical function to allow a guess at a starting value for
the inversion routine.  Basically nothing worked very well.  There were 
too many special cases and what not.  So I decided to calculate a whole bunch
of reflection and transmission values and keep their associated optical 
properties linked nearby.  

I did the very simplest thing.  I just allocate a matrix that is five columns wide.
Then I fill every row with a calculated set of optical properties and observables.
The distribution of values that I use could certainly use some work, but
they currently work.

SO... how does this thing work anyway?   There are two possible grids one for 
calculations requiring the program to find the albedo and the optical depth ($a$
and $b$) and one to find the albedo and anisotropy ($a$ and $g$).  These grids
must be allocated and initialized before use.

@  This is a pretty important routine that should have some explanation.  The
reason that it exists, is that we need some `out-of-band' information during
the minimization process.  Since the light transport calculation depends on
all sorts of stuff (e.g., the sphere parameters) and the minimization routines
just vary one or two parameters this information needs to be put somewhere.  

I chose the global variables |MM| and |RR| to save things in.

The bottom line is that you cannot do a light transport calculation without
calling this routine first.

@ Routine to incorporate flipping of sample if needed.  This is pretty
simple.  The assumption is that flipping is handled relative to the
reflection side of the sphere.  Thus even when flipping is needed,
the usual call to |RT()| will result in the correct values for the
reflectances.  The transmission values can then be calculated by
swapping the top and bottom slides.  

Technically, the value of slab should be |const| but it is not so that
we don't pay a copying overhead whenever |flip| is false (the usual case).

@ This routine fills the grid with a proper set of values.  With a little work, this 
routine could be made much faster by (1) only generating the phase function
matrix once, (2) Making only one pass through the array for each albedo value,
i.e., using the matrix left over from $b=1$ to generate the solution for $b=2$.
Unfortunately this would require a complete revision of the |Calculate_Distance|
routine.  Fortunately, this routine should only need to be calculated once at the
beginning of each run.

@ Now it seems that I must be a bit more subtle in choosing the range
of albedos to use in the grid.  Originally I just spaced them according
to
$$
a = 1 - \left[ {j-1\over n-1} \right]^3
$$
where $1\le j\le n$.  Long ago it seems that I based things only on the
square of the bracketed term, but I seem to remember that I was forced to
change it from a square to a cube to get more global convergence.

So why am I rewriting this?  Well, because it works very poorly for samples
with small albedos.  For example, when $n=11$ then the values chosen for
|a| are (1, .999, .992, .973, .936, .875, .784, .657, .488, .271, 0).
Clearly very skewed towards high albedos.  

I am considering a two part division.  I'm not too sure how it should go.
Let the first half be uniformly divided and the last half follow the
cubic scheme given above.  The list of values should then be
(1, .996, .968, .892, 0.744, .5, .4, .3, .2, .1, 0).

Maybe it would be best if I just went back to a quadratic term.  
Who knows?

In the |if| statement below, note that it could read |j>=k| and still
generate the same results.

@<Nonworking code@>=
            k = floor((GRID_SIZE-1) / 2);
            if (j > k) {
                a = 0.5 *(1-(j-k-1)/(GRID_SIZE-k-1));
                RR.slab.a = a;
            } else {
                a = (j-1.0)/(GRID_SIZE-k-1);
                RR.slab.a = 1.0-a*a*a/2;
            }

@ Well, the above code did not work well.  So I futzed around and 
sort of empirically ended up using the very simple method 
below.  The only real difference from the previous method what
that the method is now quadratic and not cubic.

@<Generate next albedo using j@>=
            a = (double) j/(GRID_SIZE-1.0);
            if (a < 0.25)
                RR.slab.a = 1.0-a*a;
            else if (a > 0.75)              
                RR.slab.a = (1.0 - a) * (1.0 -a);
            else 
                RR.slab.a = 1 - a;

@ Well, the above code has gaps.  Here is an attempt to eliminate the gaps

@<Generate next albedo using j@>=
            a = (double) j/(GRID_SIZE-1.0);
            RR.slab.a = (1.0-a*a)*(1.0-a) + (1.0-a)*(1.0-a)*a;

@ This is quite similar to |Fill_AB_Grid|, with the exception of the 
little shuffle I do at the beginning to figure out the optical thickness to
use.  The problem is that the optical thickness may not be known.  If it is
known then the only way that we could have gotten here is if the user
dictated |FIND_AG| and specified |b| and only provided two measurements.
Otherwise, the user must have made three measurements and the optical
depth can be figured out from |m.m_u|. 

This routine could also be improved by not recalculating the anisotropy
matrix for every point.  But this would only end up being a minor performance
enhancement if it were fixed.

and light loss.  Since the values |UR1| and |UT1| are for an infinite slab
sample with no light loss, the light loss out the edges must be subtracted.
It is these values that are used with the sphere formulas to convert the
modified |UR1| and |UT1| to values for |*M_R| and |*M_T|.

@ If no spheres were used in the measurement, then presumably the
measured values are the reflection and transmission.  Consequently,
we just acertain what the irradiance was and whether the
specular reflection ports were blocked and proceed accordingly.
Note that blocking the ports does not have much meaning unless
the light is collimated, and therefore the reflection and
transmission is only modified for collimated irradiance.

@ The direct incident power is $(1-f) P$. The reflected power will 
be $(1-f)\rdirect P$.  Since baffles ensure that the light cannot
reach the detector, we must bounce the light off the sphere walls to
use to above gain formulas.  The contribution will then be 
$(1-f) \rdirect (1-a_e) r_w P$.  The measured power will be 
$$
P_d = a_d (1-a_e) r_w [(1-f) \rdirect + f r_w] P \cdot G(r_s)
$$
Similarly the power falling on the detector measuring transmitted light is
$$
P_d'= a_d' \tdirect r_w'  (1-a_e')  P \cdot G'(r_s)
$$
when the `entrance' port in the transmission sphere is closed, $a_e'=0$.

The normalized sphere measurements are
$$
M_R = r_\std\cdot{R(\rdirect,r_s)-R(0,0) \over R(r_\std,r_\std)-R(0,0)}
$$
and
$$
M_T = t_\std\cdot{T(\tdirect,r_s)-T(0,0) \over T(t_\std,r_\std)-T(0,0)}

}

@ The dual beam case is different because the sphere efficiency
is equivalent for measurement of light hitting the sample first or
hitting the reference standard first.  The dual beam measurement
should report the ratio of these two reflectance measurements, thereby
eliminating the need to calculate the gain completely.   The same
holds when no sample is present.

The normalized reflectance measurement (the difference between
dual beam measurement for a port with the sample and with nothing)
is
$$
M_R = r_\std\cdot{(1-f)\rdirect  + f r_w\over (1-f')r_\std -f' r_w}
    - r_\std\cdot{(1-f) (0)  + f r_w\over (1-f')r_\std -f' r_w}
$$
or
$$
M_R = {(1-f)\rdirect \over (1-f') -f' r_w/r_\std}
$$
When $f=f'=1$, then $M_R=1$ no matter what the reflectance is.
(Leave it in this form to avoid division by zero when $f=1$.)

The normalized transmittance is simply $\tdirect$.

When $f=0$ then this result is essentially the same as the
no spheres result (because no sphere corrections are needed).
However if the number of spheres is zero, then no lost light
calculations are made and therefore that is a potential error.

@<Calc |M_R| and |M_T| for dual beam sphere@>=
{
    *M_R     = (1-MM.f_r) * R_direct/((1-MM.f_r) + MM.f_r*MM.rw_r/MM.rstd_r);
    *M_T     = T_direct;
}

@ When two integrating spheres are present then the
double integrating sphere formulas are slightly more complicated.

I am not sure what it means when |rstd_t| is not unity.

The normalized sphere measurements for two spheres are

$$
M_R = {R(\rdirect,\rdiffuse,\tdirect,\tdiffuse) - R(0,0,0,0)
\over R(r_\std,r_\std,0,0) - R(0,0,0,0)}
$$
and
$$
M_T = {T(\rdirect,\rdiffuse,\tdirect,\tdiffuse) - T(0,0,0,0)
                   \over T(0,0,1,1) - T(0,0,0,0)}
$$

Note that |R_0| and |T_0| will be zero unless one has explicitly
set the fraction |m.f_r| ore |m.f_t| to be non-zero.

@ There are at least three things that need to be considered here.
First, the number of measurements.  Second, is the metric is relative or absolute.  
And third, is the albedo fixed at zero which means that the transmission
measurement should be used instead of the reflection measurement.

@ This part was slightly tricky.  The crux of the problem was to
decide if the transmission or the reflection was trustworthy.  After
looking a bunches of measurements, I decided that the transmission
measurement was almost always more reliable.  So when there is just
a single measurement known, then use the total transmission if it 
exists.
