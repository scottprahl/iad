@**Index.
Here is a cross-reference table for the adding-doubling program.
All sections in which an identifier is
used are listed with that identifier, except that reserved words are
indexed only when they appear in format definitions, and the appearances
of identifiers in section names are not indexed. Underlined entries
correspond to where the identifier was declared. Error messages and
a few other things like ``ASCII code dependencies'' are indexed here too.
