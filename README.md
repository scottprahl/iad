## OVERVIEW

Inverse Adding-Doubling is a command-line program that determines the intrinsic optical properties of a flat scattering and absoption sample using measurements of the total reflection and transmission.  Basically, optical properties are repeatedly guessed until the calculated reflection and transmission match the measured values.

This package provides two executables `ad` and `iad`.  The first does a forward adding-doubling calculation (i.e., given the albedo, optical thickness, and anisotropy it returns the total reflection and transmission).  The second
does the reverse.

This program [Prahl et al., *Applied Optics*, **32**, 559-568, 1993](https://omlc.org/~prahl/pubs/pdfx/prahl93a.pdf) uses the Adding-Doubling method of [van de Hulst *Multiple Light Scattering*, Academic Press, 1978](https://www.amazon.com/Multiple-Light-Scattering-Formulas-Applications-ebook/dp/B01D4CMF80).  I extended the Adding-Doubling method to account for Fresnel reflection at boundaries as well as corrections that must accompany integrating sphere experiments.

Finally, integrating spheres do not always collect all the light that exits from the front or back surface of a sample.  Since this is impossible to account for the 1D adding-doubling technique, a Monte Carlo simulation is included in the inverse calculation.

Details about using the program are documented in the accompanying [manual](/doc/manual.pdf).

## INSTALLATION

In a unix environment,

```bash
    unzip iad-3-16-2.zip
    make
    ./iad -v
```

to create and executable versions the `iad` program.  See
[INSTALL.md](/INSTALL.md) for more details. 

## Usage

### Inverting a single measurement on the command line

To find the optical properties
of a sample 1mm thick that has a total reflectance of 40% and a total transmission of
10% do

```bash
    ./iad -r 0.4 -t 0.1 -d 1
```

which will generate

```
# Inverse Adding-Doubling 3-16-2 (24 Apr 2024) 
# iad -r 0.4 -t 0.1 
...
#     	Measured 	   M_R   	Measured 	   M_T   	Estimated	Estimated	Estimated
##wave	   M_R   	   fit   	   M_T   	   fit   	  mu_a   	  mu_s'  	    g    
# [nm]	  [---]  	  [---]  	  [---]  	  [---]  	  1/mm   	  1/mm   	  [---]  
     1	   0.4000	   0.4000	   0.1000	   0.0999	   0.4673	   3.9317	   0.0000	 *
```

This can be checked by doing a forward calculation using (here `-z` designates a forward
calculation, `-A 0.4673` sets the absorption coefficient, and `-j 3.9317` sets the reduced scattering coefficient).  Specifying the thickness `-d 1` is necessary because the default
thickness is infinite.


```bash
    ./iad -z -A 0.4673 -j 3.9317 -d 1
```

which produces output that ends with

```
#     	Measured 	   M_R   	Measured 	   M_T   	Estimated	Estimated	Estimated
##wave	   M_R   	   fit   	   M_T   	   fit   	  mu_a   	  mu_s'  	    g    
# [nm]	  [---]  	  [---]  	  [---]  	  [---]  	  1/mm   	  1/mm   	  [---]  
     0	   0.0000	   0.4000	   0.0000	   0.0999	   0.4673	   3.9317	   0.0000	 * 
```

to translate the reflection and transmission measurements to optical properties in the generated file `test/basic-A.txt`

> For Windows, there are executable binaries `ad.exe` and `iad.exe` compiled using [MinGW-w64](https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php).  These apps can be run using the `Command Prompt` application `cmd.exe`.  These binaries are packaged in a separate `iad-win` distributions on [github](https://github.com/scottprahl/iad/releases) or [omlc](https://omlc.org/software/iad/).

### Inverting many points

Usually one wants the optical properties over an entire spectrum.  A good example was
recently provide by @anishabahl.  This measurement was made with a spectrophotometer 
equipped with a dual beam integrating sphere.  The input data looks like this

![r and t graph](phantom-with-no-slides-RTU.svg)

The option `i 8` indicates that light is incident on the sample at an angle of 8Â°, `-X` indicates that a sphere with dual beams was used, and `-g 0.9` indicates  the default
scattering anisotropy.  Note that in the PDMS file, the index off refraction of the
sample changes with every data point

```bash
    iad -X -i 8 -g 0.9 phantom-with-no-slides.rxt
```

which should produce data that when plotted looks like

![calculated mua](phantom-with-no-slides-mua.svg)

and

![calculated mus](phantom-with-no-slides-mus.svg)



### Jupyter support

As of March 2024, there is now a python command-line script `iadplus` that will analyze an `.rxt` input file and graph the results.  Everything is assembled into a Jupyter notebook for convenience.  You may need to install some python modules to be able to use `iadplus`

    iadplus -options '-i 8 -X ' file.rxt

will produce `file.txt` as well as bunch of `.svg` files for the Jupyter notebook
`file.ipynb`
