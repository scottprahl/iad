   abstract = {A method to non-invasively and quantitatively characterize thick biological tissues by combining both experimental and computational approaches in tissue optical spectroscopy was developed and validated on fifteen porcine articular cartilage (AC) tissue samples. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to couple non-invasive reflectance and fluorescence spectroscopic measurements on freshly harvested tissues with Monte Carlo computational modeling of timeresolved propagation of both excitation light and multi-fluorophore emission. For reflectance, quantitative agreement between simulation and experiment was achieved to better than 11\%. Fluorescence data and simulations were used to extract the ratio of the absorption coefficients of constituent fluorophores for each measured AC tissue sample. This ratio could be used to monitor relative changes in concentration of the constituent fluorophores over time. The samples studied possessed the complexity and variability not found in artificial tissue-simulating phantoms and serve as a model for future optical molecular sensing studies on tissue engineered constructs intended for use in human therapeutics. An optical technique that could non-invasively and quantitatively assess soft tissue composition or physiologic status would represent a significant advance in tissue engineering. Moreover, the general approach described here for optical characterization should be broadly applicable to quantitative, non-invasive molecular sensing applications in complex, three-dimensional biological tissues.},

Reflectance and transmission spectra of \emph{in vitro} brain tissue samples were measured with a sing le-integrating-sphere spectrometer for wavelengths 400--1300\,nm and converted to absorption and reduced scattering spectra using an inverse adding-doubling technique. Optical property spectra were classified as deriving from white matter, grey matter or glioma tissue according to histopathologic diagnosis, and mean absorption and reduced scattering spectra were calculated for the three tissue categories. Absolute reduced scattering and absorption values and their relative differences between histopathological groups agreed with previously reported results with the exception that absorption coefficients were often overestimated, most likely due to biologic variability or unaccounted light loss during reflectance/transmission measurement. Absorption spectra for the three tissue classes were dominated by haemoglobin absorption below 600\,nm and water absorption above 900\,nm and generally determined the shape of corresponding clinical diffuse reflectance spectra. Reduced scattering spectral shapes followed the power curve predicted by the Rayleigh limit of Mie scattering theory. While tissue absorption governed the shape of clinical diffuse reflectance spectra, reduced scattering determined their relative emission intensities between the three tissue categories.},

The method relies on the spectral characteristics of the tissue chromophores ( water, dry tissue, and blood) and the assumption of a simple wavelength dependent expression for the determination of the reduced scattering coefficient. Because of the probe dimensions the method is suited for endoscopic measurements. The method was validated against more traditional models, such as the diffusion theory combined with adding doubling for \emph{in vitro} measurements of bovine muscle.

   abstract = {Objectives. The purpose of this study was to build a photo migration model to calculate the radiant exposure (irradiance$\times$time) in dental composite and to relate the radiant exposure with extent of cure using polymer kinetics models. Methods. A composite (Z100, Shade A2) cylinder (21\,mm diameter by 15\,mm deep) mW/cm(2), was cured with a tungsten-halogen lamp emitting 600 1\,mm above the composite for 60\,s. For each of the2$\times$1\,mm grids along the longitudinal cross section (diameter versus depth), the degree of conversion (DC) and hardness (KHN) were measured to construct the curing extent distribution. The inverse adding-doubling method was used to characterize the optical properties of the composite for the Monte Carlo model simulating the photon propagation within the composite cylinder. The calculated radiant exposure (H) distribution along the cross section was related to the curing extent DC/DCmax,, distribution and fitted with two polymer curing kinetics models, the exponential model DC = DCmax[1 -exp((ln 0.5)H/H-dc(50\%))] and Racz's model DC=DCmax/[1+(H/H-dc(50\%))$^{-2}$], where H-dc(50\%), is a fitting parameter dc dc representing the threshold for 50\% of the maximum curing level. Results and Significance. The absorption and scattering coefficients of uncured composite were higher than that of cured composite at wavelengths between 420 and 520\,nm. A roughly hemi-spheric distribution of radiant exposure in the Monte Carlo simulation result was comparable with the curing profiles determined by both DC and KHN. The relationship between DC (or KHN) and H agreed with the Racz model 50\% (r(2)=0.95) and the exponential model (r(2)=0.93). The H-50\%(dC) was 1.5(0.1),equal for the two models ($p<0.05$). The estimated radiant exposure threshold for 80\% of the maximum curing level was between 3.8 and 8.8\,J/cm(2). The simulation results verify that the radiant exposure extends to a greater depth and width for composite with tower absorption and scattering coefficients. Given the optical properties and the geometry of the composite, and the spectrum and the geometry of the light source, the Monte Carlo simulation can accurately describe the radiant exposure distribution in a composite material to predict the extent of cure.},

   abstract = {The extraction of chemical information from dense particulate suspensions, such as industrial slurries and biological suspensions, using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic measurements is complicated by sample-to-sample path length variations due to light scattering. Empirical preprocessing techniques such as multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), extended MSC and derivatives have been applied to remove these effects and in some cases have shown promise. While the performance of these techniques and other related approaches is known to depend on the nature and extent of the variations and on the measurement configuration, detailed investigations into the efficacy of these approaches under various conditions have not been previously undertaken. The main obstacle to carrying out such investigations has been the lack of, and the difficulty in obtaining, an accurate and comprehensive experimental data set. In this work, simulations that generate `actual' measurements were carried out to obtain `experimental' spectroscopic data on particulate systems. This was achieved by solving the exact transport equation for light propagation. A model system comprising four chemical components with one consisting of spherical submicron particles was considered. Total diffuse transmittance and reflectance data generated through simulations for moderate particle concentrations were used as the basis for examining the effect of particle size variations and measurement configurations on the efficacy of a number of preprocessing techniques in enhancing the performance of partial least squares (PLS) models for predicting the concentration of one of the non-scattering chemical species. Additionally, a form of extended multiplicative signal correction based on considerations arising from fundamental light scattering theory is proposed and found to perform better than the other techniques for the cases considered in the study.},

Detection of thermoelastically induced pressure transients allows reconstruction of optical properties of the sample to a depth of several millimeters with a spatial resolution of 24 mu m. Acoustic detection is performed using a specially designed piezoelectric transducer, which is transparent for optical radiation. Thus, ultrasonic signals can be recorded at the same position the tissue is illuminated. Because the optoacoustical sound source is placed in the pulsed-acoustic near field of the pressure sensor, signal distortions commonly associated with acoustical diffraction are eliminated. Therefore, the acoustic signals mimic exactly the depth profile of the absorbed energy. This is illustrated by imaging the absorption profile of a two-layered sample with different absorption coefficients, and of a dye distribution while diffusing into a gelatin phantom.},

The optical properties of these phantoms were measured at two different visible wavelengths. By comparing the fluorescence emission spectra of the turbid samples containing the saute fluorophore in different concentrations, we can calculate the concentration. In addition. the evaluation of the scattering and absorption co-efficients allow us to predict the spatial distribution of the light intensity inside and outside of the phantom.

To investigate this potentiality, angular profiles of diffuse reflectance and fluorescence emission from turbid media were evaluated experimentally and by Monte Carlo simulation for a range of incident excitation angles and sample optical properties. For emission collected within the limits of a semi-infinite excitation region, normalized angular emission profiles are symmetric, roughly Lambertian, and only weakly dependent on sample optical properties for fluorescence at all excitation angles and for diffuse reflectance at small excitation angles relative to the surface normal. Fluorescence and diffuse reflectance within the emission plane orthogonal to the oblique component of the excitation also possess this symmetric form. Diffuse reflectance within the incidence plane is biased away from the excitation source for large excitation angles. The degree of bias depends on the scattering anisotropy and albedo of the sample and results from the correlation between photon directions upon entrance and emission. Given the strong dependence of the diffuse reflectance angular emission profile shape on incident excitation angle and sample optical properties, excitation and collection geometry has the potential to induce distortions within diffuse reflectance spectra unrelated to tissue characteristics.},

The reconstruction code recovers the spatial distribution of fluorescent sources in highly scattering biological tissue. An objective function, which describes the discrepancy of measured near-infrared light with predicted numerical data on the tissue surface, is iteratively minimized to find a solution of the inverse source problem. At each iteration step the predicted data are calculated by a forward model for light propagation based on the equation of radiative transfer.

   abstract = {The treatment of cutaneous vascular lesions (port wine stains etc.) using lasers has been guided by theories based on the ``cold'' or room-temperature optical properties of the hemoglobin target chromophore. We have recently presented evidence showing that under the influence of laser irradiation, the optical properties of blood \emph{in vitro} are time and temperature dependent. Such complications are not currently subsumed into the \emph{in vivo} theory. Here, we study the time-domain optical properties of blood undergoing photocoagulation \emph{in vitro} using two newly developed time-resolved techniques. We also study the asymptotic effect of laser photocoagulation on the chemical and structural properties of the components of the blood matrix. We present evidence showing that the photocoagulation process involves significant changes in the optical absorption and scattering properties of blood, coupled with photothermally induced chemical and structural changes. We demonstrate the first use of a laser to deliberately generate magnetic resonance imaging contrast \emph{in vitro}. We show that this technique offers significant potential advantages to \emph{in vivo} intravenous chemical contrast agent injection.},

   abstract = {Laser-induced heating in an ocular phantom is measured with magnetic resonance thermography (MRT) using temperature-dependent phase changes in proton resonance frequency. The ocular phantom contains a layer of melanosomes isolated from bovine retinal pigment epithelium. The phantom is heated by the 806\,nm output of a continuous wave diode laser with an irradiance of 2.4--21.6\,W/cm(2) in a beam radius of 0.8 or 2.4\,mm, depending on the experiment. MRT is performed with a 2T magnet, and a two-turn, 6\,cm-diam, circular radio frequency coil. Two-dimensional temperature gradients are measured within the plane of the melanin layer, as well as normal to it, with a temperature resolution of VC or better. The temperature gradients extending within the melanin layer are broader than those orthogonal to the layer, consistent with the higher optical absorption and consequent heating in the melanin. The temperature gradients in the phantom measured by MRT closely approximate the predictions of a classical heat diffusion model. Three-dimensional temperature maps with a spatial resolution of 0.25\,mm in all directions are also made. Although the temporal resolution is limited in the prototype system (22.9\,s for a single image ``slice''), improvements in future implementations are likely. These results indicate that MRT has sufficient spatial and temperature resolution to monitor target tissue temperature during transpupillary thermotherapy in the human eye.},

To assess the performance of these solutions we compare the predictions for the fluence rate and two metrics of the optical penetration depth with Monte Carlo simulations. We provide results under both refractive-index matched and A mismatched conditions for optical properties where the ratio of reduced scattering to absorption lies in the range 0 less than or equal to ($\mu_s'$ / $\mu_a$) less than or equal to 10$^4$. For planar irradiation, the delta-P-1 approximation provides fluence rate profiles accurate to$\pm$16\% for depths up to six transport mean free paths (l*) over the full range of optical properties. Metrics for optical penetration depth are predicted with an accuracy of$\pm$4\%. For Gaussian irradiation using beam radii r(0) greater than or equal to 3 /*, the accuracy of the fluence rate predictions is no worse than in the planar irradiation case. For smaller beam radii, the predictions degrade significantly. Specifically for media with ($\mu_s'$/$\mu_a$) = 1 irradiated with a beam radius of r(0) = l*, the error in the fluence rate approaches 100\%. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the optical penetration depth predictions remains excellent for Gaussian beam irradiation, and degrades to only$\pm$20\% for r(0) = l*. These results show that for a given set of optical properties ($\mu_s'$/$\mu_a$), the optical penetration depth decreases with a reduction in the beam diameter. Graphs are provided to indicate the optical and geometrical conditions under which one must replace the delta-P-1 results for planar irradiation with those for Gaussian beam irradiation to maintain accurate closimetry predictions.},

In this parameter range, the apparent optical properties of targets and the depth of energy deposition are determined mainly by the scattering of the laser light. Therefore, measurements of the scattered light were performed for samples of various thicknesses by means of a modified UV-VIS spectrometer. For selected wavelengths, the angular distribution of the reflected and transmitted light intensity was determined. From these measurements, the coefficients for linear absorption, linear scattering and the scattering anisotropy were calculated using the inverse adding doubling algorithm. The results were tested by Monte Carlo simulation. With these coefficients the apparent optical penetration depths were estimated. These are about one order of magnitude larger than the ablation depths per pulse, which were determined from the weight loss of the targets.},

However, without prior knowledge of delta (equal to 1/$\mu_a$), it is not clear whether a given photoacoustic measurement is indeed performed under stress-confined conditions. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of tau(p) and tau(sr) upon efforts to obtain estimates of $\mu_a$ using photoacoustics. A numerical model was developed to simulate stress signals and investigate how measurements of $\mu_a$ are related to the ratio tau=tau(p)/tau(sr). Experimental photoacoustic measurements at several values of tau were performed to estimate $\mu_a$ of water, and a deconvolution model was applied to correct the measured $\mu_a$ without prior knowledge of tau. Under the conditions simulated in this study, tau(p) must be less than similar to0.1tau(sr) for optimal photoacoustic measurements of $\mu_a$. Since it is difficult to achieve such conditions at midinfrared wavelengths for accurate soft tissue characterization due to strong water absorption bands, a numerical deconvolution technique was implemented to overcome this limitation of conventional photoacoustics, resulting in up to a 30\% improvement in photoacoustic-based estimates of the sample $\mu_a$.},

In this study, the potential of optical spectroscopy to provide such an objective endpoint for these procedures is presented. Freshly harvested canine liver samples were exposed to 50$^\circ$C, 60$^\circ$C, and 70$^\circ$C water baths for times ranging from 0--60 min.

In addition, fluorescence and diffuse reflectance spectra were separately obtained from, the samples prepared using a portable spectroscopic system. Results of this study show that fluorescence and optical properties of liver tissues exhibit clear and consistent changes through the thermal coagulation process. Specifically, the primary peak in the fluorescence. spectra from liver tissues shifts from 480\,nm in the native state to 510\,nm in the fully coagulated state. In addition, a three to fourfold increase in the absolute intensity of the diffuse reflectance spec. tea is observed upon complete coagulation of liver tissues.

They estimated the scattering coefficient of normal and precancerous cervical epithelium using measurements of the reflectance as a function of depth from confocal images. Reflectance measurements were taken from \emph{ex vivo} cervical biopsies and fit to an exponential function based upon Beer's law attenuation. The mean scattering coefficients derived were 22\,cm(-1) for normal tissue and 69\,cm(-1) for precancerous tissue. These values are significantly lower than previously reported for bulk epithelial tissues and suggest that scattering of bulk tissue is dominated by the stroma. They also suggest that computational models to describe light propagation in epithelial tissue must incorporate different scattering coefficients for the epithelium and stroma. Further, the lower scattering of the epithelium suggests greater probing depths for fiber optic probes used by optical diagnostic devices which measure reflectance and fluorescence in epithelial tissue. The difference in scattering between normal and precancerous tissue is attributed to increased nuclear size, optical density, and chromatin texture. The scattering coefficient's measured here are consistent with predictions of numerical solutions to Maxwell's equations for epithelial cell scattering.},

Most of the absorption was from myoglobin, whereas haemoglobin absorption was negligible. Metmyoglobin was formed in the ablated tissue, which could yield a spectral signature to distinguish the ablated tissue with a simple optical probe to monitor the ablation therapy.

We found that the relative diffuse reflectance R depends on mu($\alpha$) and mu(S)' only through the ratio and that dependence can be well described with an analytical expression previously reported in the literature [S. L. Jacques, Kluwer Academic Dordrecht (1996)]. We have found that this expression for R deviates from experimental values by no more than 8\% for various illumination and detection angles within the range 0$^\circ$-30$^\circ$. Therefore, this analytical expression for R holds with good approximation even if the investigated medium presents curved or irregular surfaces. Using this expression, it is possible to translate spatial or temporal changes in the relative diffuse reflectance from a turbid medium into quantitative estimates of the corresponding changes of ( L/VL)(1/2). In the case of media with optical properties similar to those of tissue in the near infrared, we found that the changes of R/L should occur over a volume approximately 2\,mm deep and 4\,mm$\times$4\,mm wide to apply this expression.},

Although cardiovascular imaging with light offers a novel solution, application is problematic because scattering by erythrocytes causes significant optical attenuation. Methods and Results-Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a technique for detailed resolution imaging of highly scattering biological tissues. To reduce the high level of blood scattering, a method was devised whereby murine blood was replaced with a hemoglobin-based blood substitute. The scattering and absorption properties of \emph{in vitro} preparations of whole blood and dilutions of blood with a blood substitute were determined with a spectrophotometer and an inverse-adding doubling algorithm. OCT imaging of the same dilutions demonstrated a significant reduction in scattering at a hematocrit $<$5\%. A fiber-optic OCT imaging system was used to image the murine right midventricular free wall before and after isovolumic replacement with blood substitute. Strong light attenuation prevented full thickness imaging before replacement, whereas visualization of the full ventricular thickness was possible after replacement. Baseline and imaging hematocrits were 52.4$\pm$3.8\% and 3.7$\pm$1.2\%, respectively. End-systolic and end-diastolic thickness values were 0.458$\pm$0.051\,mm and 0.352$\pm$0.047 min.

The current formulation is suitable for solving transient laser transport in turbid media as well as for steady-state radiative transfer in many engineering problems. The method is applied to several example problems and compared with existing steady-state solutions and Monte Carlo transient solutions. Good agreement is found in all cases.

Using a two-color pump-probe technique \emph{in vitro}, we have identified a phenomenon we call greenlight-induced infrared absorption, where a pulse of green light causes photochemical and photothermal modifications to the chemical constituents of blood and results in enhanced infrared absorption. We identify a new chemical species, met-hemoglobin, not normally present in healthy human blood but formed during laser photocoagulation which we believe is implicated in the enhanced near-infrared absorption.},

Results: The optical properties of human and canine tonsillar tissue are similar at both wavelengths. The optical-thermal simulation was validated and predicts that at 10\,W and 1\,min of irradiation, the heat will be contained within the human tonsil. The diode laser causes more superficial heating than the Nd:YAG laser. Conclusions: The safety of irradiating human tonsils was shown.

The state of the cellular integrity of the skin samples following optical measurements was verified using transmission electron microscopy. These results were correlated to study post-mortem effects on the \emph{in vitro} optical properties of porcine dermis. We concluded that for samples stored within crushed ice for up to 30 h post-mortem the wavelength dependence of optical properties of the dermis remains unchanged while the values of the parameters vary moderately due to modification of the water content of the tissue.},

Values of optical and thermal properties determined in this study may aid in determining laser dosimetry and allow selection of an optical source wavelength for noninvasive diagnostics for laser-assisted reshaping of cartilage. Materials and Methods: The diffuse reflectance and transmittance of \emph{ex vivo} porcine nasal septal cartilage were measured in the 400--1,400\,nm spectral range by using a spectrophotometer. The reflectance and transmittance data were analyzed by using an inverse adding-doubling algorithm to obtain the absorption ($\mu_a$) and reduced scattering ($\mu_a$') coefficients. A multichannel thermal probe controller system and infrared imaging radiometer methods were applied to measure the thermal properties of cartilage. The multichannel thermal probe controller system was used as an invasive technique to measure thermal conductivity and diffusivity of cartilage at three temperatures (27, 37, 50$^\circ$C). An infrared imaging radiometer was used as a noninvasive method to measure the thermal diffusivity of cartilage by using a CO$_2$ laser source ($\lambda$ = 10.6 mu m) and an infrared focal plane array (IR-FPA) camera. Results: The optical absorption peaks at 980\,nm and 1,180\,nm in cartilage were observed and corresponded to known absorption bands of water. The determined reduced scattering coefficient gradually decreased at longer wavelengths. The thermal conductivity values of cartilage measured by using an invasive probe at 27, 37, and 50$^\circ$C were 4.78, 5.18, and 5.76\,mW/cm degrees C, respectively. The corresponding thermal diffusivity values were 1.28, 1.31, and 1.40$\times$10$^{-3}$ cm(2)/sec. Because no statistically significant difference in thermal diffusivity values with increasing temperature is found, the average thermal diffusivity is 1.32$\times$10$^{-3}$ cm(2)/sec. The numerical estimate for thermal diffusivity obtained from infrared radiometry measurements was 1.38$\times$10$^{-3}$ cm(2)/sec. Conclusion: Values of the spectral dependence of the optical absorption and reduced scattering coefficients, and thermal conductivity and diffusivity of cartilage were measured. The invasive and noninvasive diffusivity measurements were consistent and concluded that the infrared imaging radiometric technique has an advantage to determine thermal properties, because damage to the cartilage sample may be avoided. The measured values of absorption and reduced scattering coefficients can be used for predicting the optical fluence distribution in cartilage and determining optical source wavelengths for the laser-assisted cartilage reshaping studies. The thermal conductivity and diffusivity values can play role in understanding thermal-dependent phenomenon in cartilage during laser irradiation and determining laser dosimetry for the laser-assisted cartilage reshaping studies.

The loss of light at the exit port in the transmittance sphere is increasing upto 50\% of the incident power at highly forward scattering.

Results: A statistically significant difference in the threshold radiant exposure existed for each damage category for blood vessels 10--30 mu m in diameter, but not for larger vessels. For vessels over 60 mu m, complete flow stoppage was unattainable; increasing laser pulse energy produced hemorrhage. In larger vessels, coagula often were attached to the superficial vessel wall while blood flowed underneath. Monte Carlo optical and finite difference thermal modeling confirmed experimental results.

As tissue is irradiated, the optical properties change as a function of temperature due to an alteration of molecular and cellular structure. The purpose of the present study was to determine how the exposure of both fresh and previously frozen canine prostate tissue to elevated temperatures affects the optical properties. Study Design/Materials and Methods: Optical properties were measured by using a double integrating sphere spectrophotometer with an inverse adding-doubling algorithm. Measurements were made at two wavelengths (1,064\,nm and 633\,nm) on samples heated in a waterbath in 5$^\circ$-10$^\circ$ increments for 10 min through a 50$^\circ$C temperature range. Results: Upon coagulation, the absorption coefficient of fresh tissue decreased from the baseline measurement for both wavelengths (0.027$\pm$0.003--0.019$\pm$0.002 for $\lambda$ = 1,064\,nm; 0.073$\pm$0.007--0.061$\pm$0.006 for $\lambda$ = 633\,nm).

Thermal coagulation occurred during exposure to temperatures between 60$^\circ$C and 70$^\circ$C, Conclusion: Data obtained in this study indicate that thermal coagulation of tissue alters the optical properties. The extent to which these changes occur was found to be dependent on wavelength and freshness of tissue.

A Monte Carlo model of the measurement system and light transport in tissue was then used to recover the optical coefficients. The sample reflectance and transmittance were measured using a single integrating sphere `comparison' method. This has the advantage over conventional double-sphere techniques in that no corrections are required for sphere properties, and so measurements sufficiently accurate to recover the absorption coefficient reliably could be made. The optical properties of caucasian dermis were found to be approximately twice those of the underlying fat layer.

Based on a numerical algorithm to solve the time-dependent diffusion equation, the method takes into account spatial variations of the reduced scattering and absorption factors of the medium due to the presence of objects as well as random fluctuations of these factors. It is shown that the simulation method reproduces, without fitting, experimental results on tissue-like phantoms. Using experimental and simulation results, an assessment is made of the reliability for extracting the reduced scattering and absorption coefficients of the medium from time-resolved reflection and transillumination data. The simulation technique is employed to study the conditions for locating mm-sized objects immersed in a turbid medium, by direct, time-resolved imaging. We discuss a simple method to enhance the imaging power of the time-resolved technique. The mathematical justification of the method, as well as some applications to simple problems, is given. The simulation technique is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the data processing technique. Results of time-resolved reflection experiments and simulations are presented, showing that the use of the latter allow us to locate 1\,mm diameter objects under conditions which would prevent detection otherwise. Our results demonstrate that the combination of simulation and the appropriate processing of the diffusive part of the time-resolved reflected or transmitted light intensity may substantially increase the potential of the time-resolved near-infrared diffusive light imaging technique as a diagnostic tool for breast cancer detection.},

At $\mu_s$ = 100\,cm(-1) (I-s = 100 mu m) and an index mismatch of 0.05, the maximum penetration depth is approximately 2 OD.},

In this study we investigated whether changes in blood optical properties occur during a 0.5 ms laser pulse, Blood from three volunteers was irradiated \emph{in vitro} with laser pulses (radiant exposure 2--12\,J\,cm$^{-2}$, wavelength 586\,nm, pulse length 0.5\,ms). Reflection and transmission coefficients, measured using double integrating spheres, decreased slightly during the first part of the pulse. At 2.9\,J cm$^{-2}$ radiant exposure, the reflectance increased, independent of total radiant exposure of the pulse, This was-caused by blood coagulation, A second sudden increase in reflection and a significant increase in transmission occurred near 6.3 9\,cm$^{-2}$ and was accompanied by a ``popping'' sound, indicating rapid expansion of bubbles due to blood vaporization. A multilayered model of blood was used to fit calculated transmission coefficient curves to the measurements and determine temperature-dependent optical blood absorption, Heat diffusion was shown to be of minor importance, A 2.5-fold increase in absorption for temperatures increasing from 20--100$^\circ$C, accurately describes transmission coefficients measured up to 2.9\,J cm$^{-2}$.},

The overall results were comparable to those available in the literature, although only limited data are available at 790--850\,nm. The results were reproducible for a specific sample at a specific wavelength. However, when comparing the results of different samples of the same tissue or different lasers with approximately the same wavelength (e.g. argon dye laser at 630\,nm and HeNe laser at 632.8\,nm) variations are large. We believe these variations in optical properties should be explained by biological variations of the tissues. In conclusion, we report an an extensive set of \emph{in vitro} absorption and scattering properties of tissues measured with the same equipment and software, and by the same group. Although the accuracy of the method requires further improvement, it is highly likely that the other existing data in the literature have a similar level of accuracy.},

The influence of eccentric placement of an isotropic light emitting diffuser on the homogeneity of the light distribution at the bladder wall is assessed. Study Design/Materials and Methods: Whole bladder wall irradiations were performed at approximate to 630\,nm, and fluence rates were measured with and without controlled amounts of Intralipid(R) in an \emph{ex vivo} pig bladder and \emph{in vitro} in a bladder phantom. Experimental values were compared to Monte Carlo simulations using \emph{in vitro} bladder optical properties. Results: An eccentric diffuser in a clear intravesical medium produces a better uniform illumination than in a light scattering intravesical medium. Also, intravesical light absorption, e.g., by urine, would lead to a substantial loss of the energy delivered in case of light scattering cavity contents. Conclusion: The use of a clear intravesical medium guarantees the highest and most uniform fluence rate at the bladder wall during optical irradiation with an isotropic light source in clinical PDT of nonspherical bladders, whereas an intravesical light scattering medium reduces both the magnitude and the uniformity of the fluence rate.},

These factors cause changes in the absorption of ultraviolet (UV) excitation light by the tissue. Many different methods have been used in the literature to compensate measured NADH fluorescence intensities for these effects. In this paper we show on theoretical grounds that the ratio of NADH fluorescence intensity and UV diffuse reflectance intensity provides a (semi-)quantitative measure of tissue NADH concentrations. This result is corroborated by experiments with tissue phantoms in which absorption and backscattering properties were varied. Furthermore, we have verified the validity of this compensation method in isolated Langendorff-perfused rat heart preparations. In this preparation oximetric effects (of blood and tissue) are the major determinants of the metabolism-dependent UV diffuse reflectance change. Hemodynamic effects accompanying compensatory vasodilation are negligible. Movement artifacts were eliminated by simultaneously recording fluorescence and reflectance images, using a CCD camera with a biprism configuration. The results show that the NADH fluorescence/UV reflectance ratio can be used to monitor the mitochondrial redox state of the surface of intact blood-perfused myocardium.},

The recent developments of small light sources, detectors, and fiber optic probes provide opportunities to quantitatively measure these interactions, which yield information for diagnosis at the biochemical, structural, or (patho)physiological level within intact tissues. However, because of the strong scattering properties of tissues, the reemitted optical signal is often influenced by changes in biochemistry (as detected by these spectroscopic approaches) and by physiological and pathophysiological changes in tissue scattering. One challenge of biomedical optics is to uncouple the signals influenced by biochemistry, which themselves provide specificity for identifying diseased states, from those influenced by tissue scattering, which are typically unspecific to a pathology. In this review, we describe optical interactions pursued for biomedical applications (fluorescence, fluorescence lifetime, phosphorescence, and Raman from cells, cultures, and tissues) and then provide a descriptive framework for light interaction based upon tissue absorption and scattering properties. Finally, we review important endogenous and exogenous biological chromophores and describe current work to employ these signals for detection and diagnosis of disease.},

A sheet of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was used to simulate nonperfused burn eschar, and tissue perfusion within deeper layers was represented by Brownian motion from a scattering solution. A low-power He-Ne laser was focused onto the target, and the resulting speckle image was captured with a CCD camera and stored on a computer for further processing. The diameter of the speckle pattern was found to be directly proportional to the thickness of the overlying layer.

Thermally induced changes in the optical properties of tissue caused a decrease in the total transmittance and an increase in the diffuse reflectance of both fresh and precoagulated skin and aorta samples. For fresh tissue, these changes were primarily reversible until photocoagulation occurred, then both the reversible, as well as the irreversible, changes were observed. However, for precoagulated tissue the reversible changes in,he optical properties were dominant, whereas the irreversible changes were insignificant.

The fluence rate and the optical penetration depth depend on a single tissue optical parameter, namely the reduced albedo. The optical properties of (diseased) human bladder tissue, i.e. absorption coefficient, scattering coefficient, anisotropy factor and refractive index, were determined \emph{in vitro} in the wavelength range of 450--800\,nm. The integrating sphere effect and optical penetration depth were calculated with diffusion theory and compared to Monte Carlo (MC) computer simulations using approximate to 630\,nm optical properties. With increasing albedo, the integrating sphere effect calculated with diffusion approximation is increasingly larger than that found with MC simulations. Calculated and simulated optical penetration depths are in reasonable agreement. The smaller the integrating sphere effect for a given tissue absorption, the larger the optical penetration depth into the bladder wall, as the effective attenuation coefficient decreases. Optical penetration depths up to approximate to 7.5\,mm (definition dependent) can be responsible for unintended tissue damage beyond the bladder tissue. MC simulations were also performed with an eccentric light source and the uniformity of the light distribution at the bladder wall was assessed. The simulations show that even for a small eccentricity, the extremes in deviation from the mean fluence rate are large. All these results indicate that WBW PDT should be performed with some kind of \emph{in situ} light dosimetry.},

For large concentrations of scatterers and large sample thicknesses, i.e., when the amount of unscattered light is negligible, the best time-gate position is found to be at times that are later than the minimum transit time. In this case (minimum transit time), temporal resolutions from small values up to approximately 50 ps yield almost the same image resolution.

In the \emph{in vivo} experiment and the \emph{in vitro} experiment with light absorbing urine in the bladder cavity, which mimics the clinical situation, irradiation at 458\,nm wavelength resulted in the lowest fluence rate for a given optical power emitted. It cannot be completely ruled out that in an \emph{in vivo} bladder the light absorption by haemoglobin further reduces the integrating sphere effect at wavelengths shorter than 630\,nm. Thus, WBW PDT with red light (630\,nm) is technically more advantageous than that with green light (514\,nm) or blue light (488 and 458\,nm) as this gives the strongest integrating sphere effect.},

The results were then correlated with measurements of the three optical-interaction coefficients $\mu_s$, $\mu_a$, and g for wavelengths in the range 500--800\,nm for PDT-treated and nontreated rat liver and muscle tissue \emph{in vitro}. A distinct increase in the absorption coefficient was seen immediately after treatment, in agreement with the decreasing light intensity observed during the treatment, as measured with the optical dosimeter. The collimated transmittance was measured with a narrow-beam setup, and an optical integrating sphere was used to measure the diffuse reflectance and total transmittance of the samples. The corresponding optical properties were obtained by spline interpolation of Monte Carlo-simulated data. To ensure that the measured values were correct, we performed calibration measurements with suspensions of polystyrene microspheres and ink.},

The intensity profile of the scattered light is characterized by the maximum of the intensity and the full width at half maximum. These parameters have been related theoretically to the absorption and reduced scattering coefficients. The theoretical approach is based on Monte Carlo simulations, which are used to predict the intensity profile at the output surface. The boundary reflections and the source and detector characteristics have been taken into account. For a thickness lower than 6 transport mean free paths, significant differences have been found depending on whether a Mie or a Henyey-Greenstein phase function (with the same anisotropic factor) is used. This is of help in the determination of the validity range of the similarity relations. Very good agreement (error typically less than 5\%, maximal 15\%) has been found between simulations and experiments performed on microsphere suspensions.},

Fluence rates calculated and measured \emph{in vivo} at 630\,nm are in agreement with those measured previously in clinical photodynamic therapy (PDT) at 630\,nm. WBW-PDT with red light (630\,nm) will be technically more advantageous than with green light (532\,nm) because of a stronger integrating sphere effect, which reduces the variations of the fluence rate at the bladder wall when the isotropic light source is moved away from the centre of the bladder. Since the optical properties show considerable variations from bladder to bladder, and since as a result the light fluence rate at the bladder wall can Vary by d factor of 3--4 for the same non-scattered light fluence rate, we conclude that \emph{in situ} light dosimetry during clinical WBW-PDT is a necessity.},

On the basis of their smoothly varying scattering coefficient and the relatively low amount of fluorescence contributed to the mixture in comparison to other available scatterers, 1.05-mum-diameter polystyrene microspheres were selected as a scatterer. Sample inhomogeneities are simulated by preparing the phantom in a gelatin substrate.

Data are presented from dilute, absorbing, and turbid phantoms and inhomogeneous phantoms to qualitatively illustrate the effects of optical properties and sample geometry on fluorescence spectra.

  mouse dermis presented optical parameters of 2.8\,cm$^{-1}$,
  239\,cm$^{-1}$, and 0.74 for $k$, $s$, and $g$, respectively, at
